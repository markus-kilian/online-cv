    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As an analytical meteorologist I am inspired by new and complex problems,
      which I can solve by creative approaches. From the development and application
      of numerical and statistical climate models I own comprehensive experience in
      analysis and visualization of large data sets. I can produce and communicate 
      results clearly and unambiguously to broad audiences.
